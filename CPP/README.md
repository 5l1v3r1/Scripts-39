### File Notes

***note_taker.cpp***

For this script I recommend turning it into a command (at least on *nix)... It simply asks for a filename, and a message' or body contents... It is useful for taking fast notes if you're in a hurry!!! Be sure too end the message with ***EOF*** when you're finished writing!!!
