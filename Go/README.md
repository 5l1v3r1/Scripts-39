## Installing Go
For your convenience, I have created an `install_go.sh` script for you to easily install Go! Simply run `sudo ./install_go.sh` and it should install! I have currently only tested it on ***Arch*** Linux so it is possible for errors to arise...

## Notes

All executables found within the `bin/x86_64` directory have been compiled on an x86_64 Arch Linux system!

If you're to unfortunately find any issues, please simply create an issue and I will most likely fix the problem!
