NOTE: 

As JavaScript is pretty inefficient and sucks up system resources

I have set a limit on how many numbers it can test before it stops...

Feel free to change this number but beware, I have warned you...

 _   _              _  ___   __  ____          _      
| \ | | ___ _ __ __| |/ _ \ / _|/ ___|___   __| | ___ 
|  \| |/ _ \ '__/ _` | | | | |_| |   / _ \ / _` |/ _ \
| |\  |  __/ | | (_| | |_| |  _| |__| (_) | (_| |  __/
|_| \_|\___|_|  \__,_|\___/|_|  \____\___/ \__,_|\___|
                                                      

How to Use: To use this, all you have to do is look at the console log!!!

To achieve this, on most modern web browsers all you have to do is click 

Crtl + Shift + I and navigate over to Console!

	var limit = 4545;

	while(div < number && count < limit){
		if(number % div == 0){
			number += 1;
			div = 2;
		}else if(div < number/2){
			div += 1;
		}else{
			console.log(number);
			number += 1;

		count += 1;
