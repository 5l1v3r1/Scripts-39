# Scripts
This repository is for scripts that I feel are useful...

# To download all scripts, simply run: 


```GIT
git clone git@github.com:NerdOfCode/Scripts.git
```

After running this command you will have full access to all my scripts!
If you want to compile some of my scripts(Ex: C), I recommend using `gcc`...
<ul>
  <li>These scripts were built mostly on Ubuntu 17.04... Except for the one CS script  </li>
    
</ul>
